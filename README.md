<!-- ## Instacart Market Basket Analysis（IMBA） Introduction -->

### 1.Background

- Instacart is a grocery order and delivery app, which is similar to Coles or Woolworth order and delivery app in Australia. Over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200, 000 customers were provided by Instacart as open-sourced data. However, the salesman of Instacart recommends products in traditional ways or, that is to say, manually. They have not made good use of the huge amount of valuable transactional records yet. By taking advantage to analyze an ample amount of data, Instacart would predict well customer purchasing behaviour and pattern, which would strongly enhance their competitiveness.

### 2. Objectives

- Build automated big data pipeline to process data (Lambda Architecture)
- Build a machine learning model to predict customer behaviors and improve sales of reorder.  

### 3. Project plan( methods)

- This project will use AWS to build a data lake, use AWS/open-source service to process data, then integrate and build data ETL process, and use machine learning model to build a data product app, finally iterate data products and improve the process.  

- Core techniques would be used in this project:  
  
  - AWS data lake construction  
  
  - Data process coordination and integration  
  
  - Data modeling  
  
  - Big data engine application  
  
  - Data product development  
  
  - Machine learning model building  
  
  - Online/Offline Recommandation
